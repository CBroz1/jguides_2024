Notes on DioWellDDTrials
1) Trials begin at a well departure and end at the next well departure.
2) "epoch_trial_number" refers to the same variable in DioWellTrials (these are numbers of trials defined in that 
table, which begin at well arrivals and end at the next well arrival). In DioWellDDTrials, the convention we have
chosen is to "map" the initial departure of a trial to the immediately preceeding well arrival. So 
"trial_start_epoch_trial_number" for a given trial in DioWellDDTrials refers to the trial in DioWellTrials 
that has an initial well arrival immediately preceeding the initial well departure of the given trial in 
DioWellDDTrials. Similarly, "trial_end_epoch_trial_number" for a given trial in DioWellDDTrials refers to the 
trial in DioWellTrials that has an initial well arrival immediately preceeding the final well departure of 
the given trial in DioWellDDTrials.
